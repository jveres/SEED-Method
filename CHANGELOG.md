| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version                | 3.4 → 3.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| §5 Snapshot sections   | Reordered into two clusters: **dashboard** (Goal, Status, Next actions, Open questions) and **detail** (Plan, Tasks, Proof, Decisions, Lessons, Practices, Working set, Coordination). Dashboard cluster appears first so the top of the file answers "where are we / what's next / what's blocked" in one screenful. |
| "How to use this doc"  | Owner status-check instruction updated: references the dashboard cluster (first four sections) instead of listing scattered section names                                                                                                                                                                             |

| §7 State clarity       | Audit questions reordered to match dashboard-first layout (Status → Next actions → Open questions → In progress → Owner action)                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| §10a Reset table       | Row order matches new snapshot order (dashboard sections first)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Appendix D             | `WORKLOG.md` skeleton reordered to match; HTML comments mark cluster boundaries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 2.8     | SEED lifecycle: SEED describes project not release, persists across releases, optional consolidation with audit trail in release record                                                                                                                                                                          | +1 subsection in §10a, 2 skeleton updates, 0 structural changes                                                    |
| 3.0     | Identity: renamed from "SOLO playbook" to "The SEED Method"; added `## Participants` to SEED skeleton; added Global rule #8 (Identity) — agent names session-scoped, owner names and role labels are stable identifiers; log/handoff templates include role + session name                                       | Identity reestablished, +1 global rule, participant traceability model                                             |
| 3.1     | Naming contexts: role labels in procedural/authority contexts, participant names in operational artifacts; checkpoint messages use names; log templates model name usage                                                                                                                                         | +1 paragraph in rule #8, 3 template updates, 0 structural changes                                                  |
| 3.2     | Agent platform metadata: `## Participants` gains Platform column (`orchestrator · model`); log entries / handoff notes capture actual session config; Global rule #8 expanded; cookbook #17 rewritten                                                                                                            | +1 table column, +1 paragraph in rule #8, 4 template updates, 1 cookbook rewrite                                   |
| 3.3     | Best practices system: `## Practices` section (append-only, parallel to Lessons); automatic collection via DoD; practice → skill promotion path (§11a); Principle #8 "Learn both ways"; audit checks learning system health; cookbook #18                                                                        | +1 principle, +1 section (§11a), +1 WORKLOG section, +1 DoD bullet, +1 DoRD item, +1 audit check, 1 cookbook entry |
| 3.4     | Field-tested refinements: WORKLOG proof is pointer-only to README (eliminates dual-doc drift); lightweight log format for non-behavioral chunks; audit allows immediate housekeeping-safe fixes; guardrail #9 (derived data computed, not hand-maintained); high-velocity cookbook recipe                        | +1 default guardrail, +1 log format, +1 cookbook recipe, 3 tightened rules, 0 structural changes                   |
| 3.5     | Dashboard-first WORKLOG layout: snapshot sections reordered into dashboard cluster (Goal, Status, Next actions, Open questions) and detail cluster (Plan, Tasks, Proof, Decisions, Lessons, Practices, Working set, Coordination). First screenful answers "where are we / what's next / what's blocked."        | 0 new sections, 0 new rules — pure layout optimization driven by field experience                                  |

Required repo artifacts: `SEED.md`, `README.md`, `WORKLOG.md` (+ `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE.md` when log grows, + `SEED_REQUEST.md` when needed, + `docs/*.md` scratch docs as needed, + `docs/releases/release-<id>.md` after each release).
