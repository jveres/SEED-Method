## Vision (Owner wording)

Make the SEED Method publicly available and reusable by anyone on GitHub. Someone can pick it up, drop it into their own repo, and start using it for agent-driven projects.

## Success criteria

- Clear README with quick-start instructions for adoption
- Nice ASCII art logo in the README
- The SEED Method document (`SEED-Method.md`) is the core deliverable
- The Cookbook (`SEED-Method-Cookbook.md`) ships as a companion guide
- Changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`) tracks version history
- Clean, well-organized repo that's ready for public consumption

## Constraints

- Plain Markdown only — no build steps, no dependencies
- Owner approval required for any SEED Method release

## Guardrails

- No release without Owner sign-off — every version bump of the SEED Method requires explicit Owner approval before tagging/publishing. [owner] 2026-02-14

## Non-goals

- CLI tooling or automated scaffolding
- Template repo generator
- Tutorials beyond the Cookbook

## Stop conditions

- Stop before any SEED Method release (version bump) — get Owner approval first
- Stop if considering structural changes to `SEED-Method.md` that alter the methodology

## Timeline / urgency

- No deadline. Quality over speed.

## Clarifications

- The repo already contains `SEED-Method.md` (v3.5), `SEED-Method-Cookbook.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`. The work is about making these publicly presentable — README, repo polish, and public-readiness.
