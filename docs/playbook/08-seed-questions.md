## 8) Default question script (when requesting SEED)

Ask any SEED questions not already answered. If the Owner has provided partial answers, confirm understanding and ask only the remaining questions.

Questions (in order):

1. Vision: what should exist when done?
2. Success criteria: what does a great result look like? What matters most?
3. Constraints: any hard requirements?
4. Non-goals: anything explicitly out of scope?
5. Stop conditions: when should we pause and ask you?
6. Timeline or urgency: any deadline or pace expectation? (affects ceremony level)
