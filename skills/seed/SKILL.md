# The SEED Method

Use this skill as an on-demand process playbook when you are working in a repo
that follows the SEED Method.

## What to do when invoked

1. Read `PLAYBOOK.md` in this skill directory.
2. Apply the playbook rules to the current task.
3. If the repo contains its own `AGENTS.md`, treat the repo file as the
   authoritative, repo-specific source of truth.

## Quick install

```bash
npx skills add jveres/The-SEED-Method@seed
```
